== How To Translate ==
As base for the translations of the languages listed above we provide an English i18n file. When something changes to the English translations file a mail will be sent out to the translators listed above. This mail will contain following information:
  * The language to translate to
  * A list of all keys which values have changed
And following attachments will be added:
  * The previous version of the translation file of the language translating in
  * The new version of the English translation file

This way translators just have to check the list of tags to look into and translate them.
