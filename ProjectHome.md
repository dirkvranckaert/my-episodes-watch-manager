# Mobile Android Project #
The aim of this project is to create a mobile Android application (so written in Java) to manage http://www.MyEpisodes.com. We're not about to manage entire http://www.MyEpisodes.com but only the part that is relevant to be used on a phone, the part where you get a list of episodes still to watch and where you can say 'Hey Android, I've just watched this show'.

## Documentation ##
Some interesting wiki pages you should look at:
  * Interface Mockup @ [InterfaceMockup](InterfaceMockup.md)
  * Unofficial releases: http://my-episodes-watch-manager.googlecode.com/svn/nightlyBuilds/
  * Offical Market releases: [ReleaseManagement](ReleaseManagement.md)
  * Screenshots [Screenshots](Screenshots.md)

## Download Latest Version ##

## Language Support ##
The application is currently translated into five languages:
  * English
  * German
  * Spanish
  * French
  * Hungarian
  * Italian
  * Latvian
  * Dutch
  * Portuguese
  * Swedish
However we would like the application to be translated in a lot more languages. According to our statistics these are the languages of the users that most use the application and that are not yet supported:
  * Chinese
  * Polish
However when your language isn't listed here yet you can still participate and become an official **MyEpisodes Watch Manager** translator. Details on how to participate can be found below.
